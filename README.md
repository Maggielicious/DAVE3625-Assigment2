We chose Task Nr 2, and because stock-prices are countinious values we chose to use regression for predictions.

First we did a linear regression which only had a 50% accuracy based on the r2 score.

After that we also tried using polynomial regression, this type of regression makes more sense when dealing with for example stocks,
because the value of a stock can go up and down and does not necessarily only increase or decrease.
The polynomial regression also had a lot better accuracy with 83%. And a lot lower MSE aswell.
